# 🎮 Tetris Inventory System V2

A Tetris-style inventory system prototype built in Unity as part of my Games Engine Programming module. This system supports dynamic item placement, rotation, and interaction in a grid-based UI, inspired by inventories in games like *Resident Evil 4* or *Escape from Tarkov*.

> 🧠 Designed for rapid prototyping and experimentation with Unity UI, input handling, and custom data structures.
